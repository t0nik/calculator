A simple web calculator with mouse and keyboard functionality. Grants visual feedback when clicking with mouse or pressing the buttons with keyboard. This project was made to confirm that I'm comfortable with DOM manipulation, styling and injecting styles, JS Event Listeners, Clean Code practices and JS Syntax.
